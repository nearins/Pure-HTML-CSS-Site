# Pure-HTML5-CSS3-Poject
Website created in Pure CSS and HTML.
I was testing float, border-box, flex, gradients, hidden menu without javascript and many other things. 
I meet a lot of problems working with it , but I also learned a lot. I know that code isn't perfect, that can be created in different ways (I would appreciate feedback) , but I am happy , because every day I know more ,and I am closer to start my first Job as a Junior Front End Developer.
